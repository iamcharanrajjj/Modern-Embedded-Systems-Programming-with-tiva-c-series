use t4mc123h6gpm datasheet
1. search the datasheet for the memory map.
2. look for GPIO port F, to control your LED in memory map
3. copy the starting address of gpio F to the memory view and watch what comes up,
4. this would make to look as if the memory blocks are empty, the typical reason is the h/w block is switched off
   this is the common technique to block the certain parts of the switch 
5. first we need to discover how to turn on the GPIO port- F

the logical related group of bits are documented below the register block diagram
1. in the datasheet check out the page no. 340, which says about :  General-Purpose  Input/Output  Run  Mode  Clock  Gating  Control (RCGCGPIO),
> whose offset is 0x608
> whose base address is 0x400F.E000
addup both the address and load 0x00000020 in the data field, which is same as 5 in hexadecimal cuz after 15 i.e 16 = 1; 17 = 2;.... 20 = 5
we wanted 5 cuz, see.. in the diagram (RW-headers) R0-R5 must be set to high.
in the typical format of the register block diagram : 
rw -> read write;
ro ->read only; 
wo -> write only;

to select the pin directions output: checkout the page no.663: Register  2:  GPIO  Direction  (GPIODIR)
> whose offset address is 0x400
now set the bits  of the lower nibble first - third to 1, fourth bit 0 i.e 'e' in hex.

to set the function of the pins to digital output checkout the page no.682: register  8: GPIO  Digital  Enable  (GPIODEN),
> whose offset is 0x51C/ if you don't find use f address block
further down with gpio - F address block, now set the bits of lower nibble, first - third to 1, fourth bit 0 i.e 'e' in hex.


now, finally control the LED through GPIO-F data register located at, 40025'3fc/ 0x3fc i.e our last memory block with lower nibble
writing hex '2'(for RED) so that bits are setting up the lowest bit 1.
writing hex '4'(for blue) so that bits are setting up the lowest bit 2.
writing hex '8'(for green) so that bits are setting up the lowest bit 3.
try to turn off the led by writing zero at the same location.
