Coding Sessions of short, focused, hands-on lessons about embedded systems programming, covering a wide range of topics. 

 My coding sessions will covers a wide range of topics, including how computers count, how to change the flow of control through your code, variables and pointers, how a computer can change anything outside (like blinking an LED), preprocessor and the “volatile” keyword in C, bit-wise operators in C, arrays and pointer arithmetic, functions in C and the call stack, modules, recursion, ARM Application Procedure Call Standard (AAPCS), stack overflow and other pitfalls of functions, standard integers (stdint.h) and mixing integer types, structures in C and Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS), startup code, interrupts, GNU-ARM Toolchain and Eclipse IDE, race conditions, foreground-background architecture (“Superloop”), real-time operating systems (RTOS), synchronization and communication among concurrent threads
